Question 1,"Describe a scenario where you would choose Python over Java for a machine learning project, highlighting the advantages of your chosen language in that context.","Python's rich ecosystem of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn makes it significantly faster for prototyping and development in ML. Java offers performance advantages at scale, but Python's ease of use outweighs this for initial development and experimentation.",
Question 2,"Explain the difference between `==` and `===` in Javascript, and provide an example demonstrating a situation where this distinction is crucial.","`==` performs loose comparison, checking for equality after type coercion. `===` performs strict comparison, checking for both value and type equality.  For example, `1 == ""1""` is true, but `1 === ""1""` is false, highlighting the importance of strict equality in certain contexts.",
Question 3,"Design a simple database schema using SQL for managing a library's book inventory, including tables for books, members, and loans.  Include relevant attributes and relationships.","We'd have `Books` (bookID, title, author, ISBN), `Members` (memberID, name, address), and `Loans` (loanID, bookID, memberID, loanDate, returnDate).  `Loans` would have foreign keys referencing `Books` and `Members`, establishing a many-to-many relationship.",
Question 4,"Explain the concept of overfitting in the context of deep learning, and describe a technique used to mitigate it.","Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, performing poorly on unseen data.  Techniques like regularization (L1 or L2), dropout, or early stopping prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model's complexity or monitoring its performance on a validation set.",
Question 5,Compare and contrast the use of C and HTML in the development of a web application.  Where would you use each language and why?,"C is typically used for backend server-side logic, potentially creating high-performance components or interacting directly with system hardware. HTML structures the front-end, creating the visual layout and content of the web page seen by the user, defining elements and their relationships.",
