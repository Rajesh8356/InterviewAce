Question 1,"Describe a scenario where you would choose Flutter over native Android development (Java/Kotlin) and explain your reasoning, considering factors like performance, development speed, and maintainability.","Flutter excels when rapid cross-platform development is prioritized, especially for MVPs or projects with similar UI/UX across iOS and Android.  Native development might be preferred for performance-critical apps or when utilizing platform-specific features heavily reliant on native libraries.",
Question 2,"You need to design a scalable database for a social media application using SQL.  How would you structure the tables to efficiently handle user profiles, posts, comments, and likes, minimizing data redundancy and ensuring efficient querying?","I'd use separate tables for users (userID, username, etc.), posts (postID, userID, content), comments (commentID, postID, userID, text), and likes (likeID, userID, postID).  Foreign keys would link these tables, allowing efficient querying and preventing redundancy.  Proper indexing would optimize performance.",
Question 3,Explain the differences between `malloc()` and `new` in C++ and when you would choose one over the other.  Include considerations for exception handling and memory management.,"`malloc()` allocates raw memory, requiring manual memory management with `free()`. `new` allocates memory and calls the constructor, handling object creation.  `new` is preferred for objects as it's safer and handles exceptions; `malloc()` is used for raw memory blocks when fine-grained control is needed.",
Question 4,"You're building a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Describe how you would implement a smooth, parallax scrolling effect for a hero image using only these technologies.  What CSS properties would be key?","I'd use JavaScript to track the scroll position.  Based on this, I'd adjust the `background-position` CSS property of the hero image container using `transform: translate3d(x, y, 0)` for smooth scrolling.  Crucially, I'd adjust `background-attachment: fixed;` to create the parallax effect relative to the viewport.",
Question 5,"Describe a situation where you had to debug a complex issue involving multiple AWS services (e.g., EC2, S3, Lambda). What strategies did you employ to identify and resolve the problem?","I used CloudWatch logs to track errors and performance issues across different services.  Analyzing Lambda function logs alongside S3 access logs and EC2 instance metrics helped pinpoint the source of the problem. I also leveraged AWS X-Ray for tracing requests across services, which pinpointed latency and bottlenecks effectively.",
