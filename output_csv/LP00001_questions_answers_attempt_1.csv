Question 1,"Describe a situation where you'd choose Python over Java for a project, highlighting the trade-offs involved.","Python's rapid prototyping capabilities and extensive libraries make it ideal for projects prioritizing speed of development, especially data science or scripting tasks.  However, Java offers better performance and scalability for large, complex applications demanding high reliability. The choice depends on project needs.",
Question 2,"Explain the difference between `const` and `let` in JavaScript, and when you'd use each.","`const` declares a variable with a constant value; its value cannot be reassigned after initialization. `let` declares a variable with block scope, allowing reassignment. Use `const` for values that shouldn't change and `let` for variables whose values might be updated within their scope.",
Question 3,How would you optimize a slow SQL query involving a large table?  Provide at least two strategies.,"Optimize by adding appropriate indexes to frequently queried columns to speed up lookups.  Also, analyze the query for potential bottlenecks, such as full table scans, and rewrite it using more efficient joins and filtering techniques (WHERE clauses).",
Question 4,Compare and contrast Flutter and native Android development (using Java/Kotlin). What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?,"Flutter uses Dart and a single codebase for cross-platform development, offering faster development cycles but potentially sacrificing some performance compared to native apps optimized for a specific platform. Native development provides better performance and access to platform-specific features but requires more code and resources.",
Question 5,"You need to design a user interface for a mobile application using Figma, then implement it using Flutter. Describe your workflow and how you'd ensure consistency between the design and the final product.","I'd first design the UI in Figma, creating detailed mockups and specifications, including precise color palettes and font styles. Then, using these as a guide, I'd implement the UI in Flutter, referencing Figma assets and striving for pixel-perfect accuracy.  Regular comparison and iterative refinement would maintain consistency.",
